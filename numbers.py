print(2+3)  # the addition operation in python
print(4_4)  # the subtraction operation in python
print(3*6)  # the multiplication operation in python
print(10 % 3)  # the modulus operation which gives the remainder as answer
print(10 / 3)  # this is a divisional operation
print(10//3)  # this gives a whole answer and ignores the remainder
print(3**2) # this shows the power

# THE METHODS USED
print(abs(-10))  # this brings absolute value of a number
print(pow(3, 2))  # this also gives power of a value
print(max(4, 6))  # this shows the maximum number
print(min(4, 6))  # this shows the minimum number
print(round(3.22))  # this rounds off the value of a number

# importing other maths function

from math import *
print(floor(3.7))  # the floor method prints lowest value and ignores the decimal places
print(ceil(3.2))  # this will round off the number whatever the values are available
print(sqrt(36))  # this will the square root of an umber
